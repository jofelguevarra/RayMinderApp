This directoria is dedicated to Scripts to use for the ESP32-C3 Zero that was used for the assignment submission for task 3 of DES222.

**RayMinder** is the most important folder, as it has the official Script used for the RayMinder: UV Smart Caps for Friends.

**Components** has working scripts for the different modules that can later be combined into one big script.

**TestsForModules** are test scripts for the modules, with which I simply tested, whether and how the modules work.

**Trials** has trial scripts in it, with which I tried to figure out how to use the modules.
