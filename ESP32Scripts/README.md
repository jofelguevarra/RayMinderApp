This directoria is dedicated to Scripts to use for the ESP32 C3 Zero.
**Components** has working scripts for the different modules that can later be combined into one big script.
**TestsForModules** are test scripts for the modules, with which I simply tested, whether and how the modules work.
**Trials** has trial scripts in it, with which I tried to figure out how to use the modules.

In the future, there will be a folder with a script for the actual RayMinders.
